Easy to use tools to help make your website GDPR-compliant. Fully documented, extendable and developer-friendly.

== Description ==

Easy to use tools to help make your website GDPR-compliant.

GDPR is a whopping 88 pages of legal text. Becoming compliant takes a lot more than just adding a couple of checkboxes to your forms! But worry not, we’ve got it covered. With help from [Triniti](https://triniti.eu), one of the top business and IT law firms in Europe, we’ve put together this plugin and written a thorough guide for making WordPress sites compliant with minimal effort.

You don't need to drown your customers in pointless acceptance checkboxes if you know what you're doing!

Using The GDPR Framework does NOT guarantee compliance to GDPR. This plugin gives you general information and tools, but is NOT meant to serve as complete compliance package. Compliance to GDPR is risk-based ongoing process that involves your whole business. Codelight is not eligible for any claim or action based on any information or functionality provided by this plugin.
