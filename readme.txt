== Description ==

The easiest way to make your WordPress site GDPR compliant!

GDPR is a whopping 88 pages of legal text. Becoming compliant takes a lot more than just adding a couple of checkboxes to your forms! But worry not, we’ve got it covered. With help from [Triniti](https://triniti.eu), one of the top business and IT law firms in Europe, we’ve put together this plugin and written a thorough guide for making WordPress sites compliant with minimal effort.

You don't need to drown your customers in pointless acceptance checkboxes if you know what you're doing!
